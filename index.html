        <p>The first project I will be displaying is my summer homework problem. But 
          something bad happened. My friend that does the same class as me said 
          “hey Oliver! Did you do your summer homework?” and I said “what summer 
          homework”. And so he replied “the one our teacher sent to us.” and so I 
          checked what my friend sent me and it looked like it was a link to our 
          teachers assignment saying, “welcome to ap computer science!!! Heres a 
          list of options of what you can do.” and at that moment I was so 
          exhausted because I was going to relax that day but what I didn't know 
          is that I had to go through 9 lessons on scratch that I had to complete 
          but I only had a week left of summer until school is back. Also I'm 
          coming back from a 2 year break of programming so of course I forgot 
          about everything  so I spent the next 3 hours finishing my whole summer 
          homework and I actually finished it in time. I then ask our teacher 
          “how come I'm just learning about summer homework now?” and he said, 
          “oh you must be one of the new kids that joined the class later, don't 
          worry about it I will give you as much time as you need to complete the 
          summer work.” and now take a look at my scratch project ping pong game!

        <p>
          The next project I will be displaying is my drawing app that I made with 
          my friend, the same one who told me about the summer homework. Our teacher 
          made us freestyle a draft for a drawing app and me and my partner picked it 
          up pretty quickly so then I started working on the actual drawing tool and
           how to make sure that the person will draw wherever the mouse follows and
            my partner was working on the buttons on the screen to change color and
          change into different tools that the user drawing needs to make there
         drawing. This whole process took about a month to make and actually 
        isn't bad from a 2 month experienced programmer that is making a drawing
         app so that will be my next project that's displayed.

        <p>
         This project I will be displaying will be a presentation of a hero's 
          journey of the movie jumanji that I did with my friends in 7th grade. We 
          had a script and had to say out parts of the slide because we have to be 
          facing forward away from the screen to make it look more professional. The 
          google slides that we did it on were so good I think we had one of the best 
          then if not we have the best in the whole class. For that project we talked
           about a hero's journey, like the quest they go through and the problem
            they are facing and their powers, and like a normal superhero movie layout.
             We added a scene that made the whole class laugh. We added a scene where
              Kevin Hart is riding an elephant and says a cuss word which was funny 
              to see the whole class laugh at. But overall it was definitely one of 
              the best projects I ever did in that class.

        <p>
          This is the newer model of the drawing app which we called version 2 or V2. 
          Me and my partner David made a couple of changes in the looks and trying to fix the 
          app in general. Some problems we had were a glitch problem where the app ran very slow 
          and there was a big delay, And also some buttons wouldnt work as we wanted them to. 
          After hard work we fixed all issues and this is the product we have right now. Some changes
          we made were the color button, an informational menu, we added a custom block where you can 
          plot points and the app will save your plotted points if you would want to use them again. In 
          the end we finished version 2 with a new and improved model. Click the link if you want to test
          it out.

         Another project that I will be showing on 
         this website is going to be the AP Create 
         Final Project. On the first day of 
         brainstorming, my partner wasn't at school 
         that day, so I had to do all the 
         brainstorming myself. In the code 
         requirements for the game you need a List, 
         Parameter, Selection, and Iteration. And 
         in my head I was thinking about a boxing 
         game that we could create and I figured out 
         a way to fit all of those requirements into 
         the game. And when my friend got back to 
         school, I told him about my idea and from 
         that point it was set. Day after day, hour 
         after hour, we tested all of things that we 
         could use for the game and on the first day 
         we created the characters and their functions.
          And as the due date was getting closer, 
          my partner and I finished our game, and we 
          probably had the simplest of code, but our 
          game was definitely the most fun to play 
          with. Click the link if you want to play
           the game yourself.

         My last project that I will show you guys is the pico 
         project, Where we did this project on our last week of school.
          This light doesnt need a big 
         explanation, but what this light does 
         is that it acts like a trafficlight. 
         Making the light turn red, then to 
         green, then to yellow, and back to red 
         in a cycle. In between each light color
          changes there will always be time for 
          the light to be displaying, since
           traffic lights are not blinking lights.
