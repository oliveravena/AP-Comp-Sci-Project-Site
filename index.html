        <p>The first project I will be displaying is my summer homework problem. But 
          something bad happened. My friend that does the same class as me said 
          “hey Oliver! Did you do your summer homework?” and I said “what summer 
          homework”. And so he replied “the one our teacher sent to us.” and so I 
          checked what my friend sent me and it looked like it was a link to our 
          teachers assignment saying, “welcome to ap computer science!!! Heres a 
          list of options of what you can do.” and at that moment I was so 
          exhausted because I was going to relax that day but what I didn't know 
          is that I had to go through 9 lessons on scratch that I had to complete 
          but I only had a week left of summer until school is back. Also I'm 
          coming back from a 2 year break of programming so of course I forgot 
          about everything  so I spent the next 3 hours finishing my whole summer 
          homework and I actually finished it in time. I then ask our teacher 
          “how come I'm just learning about summer homework now?” and he said, 
          “oh you must be one of the new kids that joined the class later, don't 
          worry about it I will give you as much time as you need to complete the 
          summer work.” and now take a look at my scratch project ping pong game!

        <p>
          The next project I will be displaying is my drawing app that I made with 
          my friend, the same one who told me about the summer homework. Our teacher 
          made us freestyle a draft for a drawing app and me and my partner picked it 
          up pretty quickly so then I started working on the actual drawing tool and
           how to make sure that the person will draw wherever the mouse follows and
            my partner was working on the buttons on the screen to change color and
          change into different tools that the user drawing needs to make there
         drawing. This whole process took about a month to make and actually 
        isn't bad from a 2 month experienced programmer that is making a drawing
         app so that will be my next project that's displayed.

        <p>
          My final project I will be displaying will be a presentation of a hero's 
          journey of the movie jumanji that I did with my friends in 7th grade. We 
          had a script and had to say out parts of the slide because we have to be 
          facing forward away from the screen to make it look more professional. The 
          google slides that we did it on were so good I think we had one of the best 
          then if not we have the best in the whole class. For that project we talked
           about a hero's journey, like the quest they go through and the problem
            they are facing and their powers, and like a normal superhero movie layout.
             We added a scene that made the whole class laugh. We added a scene where
              Kevin Hart is riding an elephant and says a cuss word which was funny 
              to see the whole class laugh at. But overall it was definitely one of 
              the best projects I ever did in that class.
